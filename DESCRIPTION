Description: Sets of algorithms that can be used for GS (Genomic Selection),including machine learning models and tradition models like Bayes.
              For machine learning methods, ANN (Artificial Neural Network), RKHS (Reproducing kernel Hilbert space), RF(Random Forest), 
              GBM(Generalized Boosted Regression Models), SVM(support vector machine) is included. For traditional methods, BayesA, BayesB, 
              BayesC, BayesLasso, BayesRR (Bayesian Ridge Regression),GBLUP(Genomic Best Linear Unbiased Prediction), 
              rrBLUP(ridge regression best linear unbiased prediction)is included. Simple validation is implemented to get the prediction accuracy,
              In order to get a better performance for machine learning methods, an auto hyperparameter adjusting is implemented.
